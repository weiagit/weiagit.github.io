Hi! I'm a senior at the University of Michigan majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics, with an expected graduation of May 2026. I am interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science to go into a career in research, with interests in software engineering and security.

I'm currently an Undergraduate Researcher in [Prof. Westley Weimer's](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/) lab, working with PhD student [Priscila Santiesteban](https://pasantiesteban.github.io/ps.gitbub.io/) to investigate human factors of productivity in Software Engineering.

In summer 2023 and 2024, I was a Research Assistant at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) through the [Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) (REUSE) program. I worked with PhD student [Matthew Davis](https://cmumatt.github.io/) and professors [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Brad Myers](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/) to build [NaNofuzz](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=penrose.nanofuzz) and TerzoN, which are testing tools for TypeScript that support fuzzing and property-based testing.

I've been teaching as an Instructional Aide for [Discrete Mathematics](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/course-descriptions/eecs-203/) (EECS 203) since Winter 2024, within the U-M Computer Science and Engineering Department. I currently serve as Czar of the Homework Management Team.

I've also played violin and sung in choir for many years, and I continue to play in the U-M Campus Symphony Orchestra.

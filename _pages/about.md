Hi! I'm a junior at the [University of Michigan](https://www.engin.umich.edu/) majoring in [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and minoring in [Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math), with an expected graduation of May 2026. I am interested in pursuing a PhD to go into a career in research, with interests in software engineering and security.

In summer 2023 and 2024, I was a Research Assistant at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://s3d.cmu.edu/) through the [Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) (REUSE) program. I worked with PhD student [Matthew Davis](https://cmumatt.github.io/) and professors [Joshua Sunshine](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Brad Myers](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/) to build [NaNofuzz](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=penrose.nanofuzz), a testing tool for TypeScript programs that can be installed in VS Code.

I've taught as an Instructional Aide for [Discrete Mathematics](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/course-information/course-descriptions/eecs-203/) (EECS 203) since Winter 2024 in the U-M Computer Science and Engineering Department.

I've also played violin and sung in choir for many years, and I continue to play in the U-M Campus Symphony Orchestra.

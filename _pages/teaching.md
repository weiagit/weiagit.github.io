### Discrete Mathematics (EECS 203)

I have taught as an Instructional Aide for Discrete Mathematics (EECS 203) since Winter 2024 at the University of Michigan. I teach a class section, hold office hours, write homework problems, and grade exams. I am part of the homework management subteam.

##### Topics:

- Logic, proofs, induction
- Sets, functions
- Countability
- Graphs, trees
- Counting, combinatorics

In summer 2023, I was a Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University through the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE) program. I worked with PhD student Matthew Davis and professors Joshua Sunshine and Brad Myers to produce TestLoop, a theoretical process model containing 7 steps that programmers perform while generating test suites.

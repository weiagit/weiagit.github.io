In summer 2024, I was a Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University through the Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE) program. I worked with PhD student Matthew Davis and professors Joshua Sunshine and Brad Myers to build [NaNofuzz](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=penrose.nanofuzz), a testing tool for TypeScript programs that can be installed in VS Code.

NaNofuzz is a fuzzing-based tool that also supports example-based testing and property-based testing. We are studying how these different modes of testing interact with each other.
